# Security Requirements

## 1. Secrets and credentials

- Commit `.env.example` with placeholder names only; `.env` is gitignored.
- Keep the Akeyless Access Key/token, the three active provider credentials, and SQLCipher key in protected backend configuration. Never expose them in frontend assets or endpoints.
- For the hackathon, environment variables are acceptable for runtime secrets, but do not describe them as production-grade secret management. Akeyless API-key authentication is documented for quick POCs; Akeyless recommends workload identity/cloud IAM patterns for production deployments.
- The 3-of-2 configuration is the only supported hackathon demo setup. Use synthetic secrets only. The API authentication is demo-only, and production deployments are rejected.
- Use distinct provider credentials/projects where practical and least privilege for each provider. No provider needs access to another provider.
- The orchestrator must validate all configured key references against a fixed provider registry.

## 2. Akeyless requirements

- Create three enabled AES-256-GCM keys if the account's actual plan allows it.
- Use the documented Encrypt/Decrypt API format; don't guess parameter names or response formats.
- The Encrypt API accepts plaintext string and supports Base64 input format. The Decrypt API accepts Base64 ciphertext and supports Base64 output format. Define a consistent binary share round trip and verify it with tests.
- Include stable context fields: `record_id`, `version`, `share_index`, `provider_id`, `format_version`.
- Supply the same encryption context to Decrypt.
- Normalize Akeyless errors; do not expose response bodies/tokens to client or logs.
- The backend is allowed to receive plaintext share output in this agreed threat model. Therefore key-scoped permissions improve least privilege but do not make the backend resistant to full compromise.

## 3. SSS requirements

- Use a reviewed, maintained library with secure randomness.
- Do not roll custom SSS arithmetic or use Python `random` for shares/record IDs.
- Configure exactly `shares=3`, `threshold=2`.
- Reject malformed shares, duplicate indices, wrong versions and fewer than two shares.
- Test all three combinations of two shares with one synthetic test secret.
- Do not claim the library proves threshold security without verifying its implementation/tests/docs.

## 4. SQLCipher requirements

- Use a driver linked to SQLCipher, not standard Python sqlite3.
- Verify reported `cipher_version` during startup/health validation.
- Load stable SQLCipher key from protected config before normal queries.
- Use explicit first-run database initialization only. Existing DB open/key/integrity errors must fail closed.
- Run `cipher_integrity_check` if supported/configured, especially at startup for the small MVP DB.
- Restrict file permissions; keep database in persistent storage; protect backups separately.
- Keep DB key separate from Akeyless keys.
- Do not claim protection against a compromised process holding the DB key.

## 5. HTTP/API

- HTTPS in deployment.
- Authenticate every store/recover/status request; authorize by owner.
- Enforce a 4 KiB UTF-8 byte limit for the secret for MVP (application product limit, not a platform limit).
- `Cache-Control: no-store` for recovery responses.
- Never log request bodies, response bodies for recovery, plaintext, shares, tokens, keys, DB URLs or connection strings.
- Use stable public error messages; detailed provider errors only in redacted internal logs.
- Apply explicit connect and read timeouts and bounded retries.

## 6. Memory/temporary data

- No plaintext temporary files or persistent caches.
- Keep plaintext lifetime short; use `try/finally` and mutable `bytearray` buffers when compatible with library APIs.
- Do not add Rust.
- Explain that complete memory erasure is not guaranteed in Python because immutable objects and dependencies may create copies.

## 7. Provider-specific notes

- **Upstash Redis:** no TTL for shares; ensure eviction policy cannot evict shares. Store encrypted ciphertext only.
- **Neon PostgreSQL:** use TLS/secure connection string, dedicated table and least-privilege DB role.
- **Firebase Firestore:** use server-side Admin SDK credentials; do not bundle service-account key in client; use a dedicated collection and deterministic document IDs.

## 8. Claims to avoid

Never claim: fully compromised backend cannot access secrets; zeroization guaranteed; cross-provider atomic transaction; every provider backup is physically erased after delete; recovery works if Akeyless is unavailable; or the demo authentication provides production identity/tenant isolation.
